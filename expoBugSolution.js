The solution often involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Check `package.json` for dependency conflicts or outdated packages:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to examine your dependency tree. Look for conflicting versions or outdated libraries known to cause issues with Expo.
2. **Clean your project:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and your `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file. Then, reinstall your dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you're using the latest version of the Expo CLI by running `expo upgrade` or reinstalling the CLI globally using `npm install -g expo-cli`
4. **Review your `app.json`:** Look for any typos or unexpected settings within your app's configuration file. 
5. **Check for Native Module Issues:**  If you have native modules integrated into your project, issues with their setup or compatibility with your current expo SDK version may cause crashes.  Review these carefully.
6. **Search for related issues:** Use your error messages (if any) to perform a targeted search online for solutions, focusing on Expo's GitHub issue tracker and the Expo community forums.
7. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If you can't find a solution after exhaustive troubleshooting, create a minimal project that reproduces the issue. This will help you better isolate the problem and report it effectively.
