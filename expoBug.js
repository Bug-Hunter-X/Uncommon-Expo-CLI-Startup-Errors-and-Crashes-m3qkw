This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `expo start` command and there's an issue with your project's configuration or dependencies.  The error message itself isn't always very specific, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.  Sometimes, it manifests as a seemingly random crash or hang during the start-up process, and other times it might be accompanied by more specific error messages related to specific packages or configurations within the `package.json` or `app.json` files.
